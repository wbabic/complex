* complex
A cross platform library for complex numbers, geometry and transforms

** Usage
run cljs test using phantomjs
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  lein cleantest
#+END_SRC

run clojure test from the repl
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  lein repl
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (require 'complex.test-runner)
  (complex.test-runner/runner)
#+END_SRC

how to get lein test to use complex.test-runner?

** implementation
*** vector
    in vector.cljs
    algebraic operations for vectors and matrices

    sum product
    scal-mul
    dot
    len len-sq
    angle
    midpoint
    mvmult
    mmmult
    mat-inverse

*** complex number
    in complex.cljs

    represented as
    a vector of two rational numbers
    [x y] or [r a]
    with the possibility of being infinity
    where 1/zero = infinity and 1/infinity = zero
    and zero/zero = infinity/infinity = undefined

    complex numbers can be added, multiplied and conjugated
    they have a length and an angle

*** linear fractional transformation
    in trasnforms.cljs

    represented as
    a vector of four complex numbers
    [a b c d]
    that can be normalized so that
    ad - bc = 1
    has a determinant, trace, inverse
    can be composed and conjugated

    translation rotation scaling inversion
    all represented as 4-vectors of complex number

    composition of transformation implemented as
    matrix multipliation of 2x2 complex matrices

    inverse of a transformation as inverse of a 2x2 matrix
    conjugation by a conjugataing map as composition
    of three matrices

*** image of a generalized circle
    image of a circle from
    Grandma's recipe and project 3.7 in Indra's Pearls

    my idea:
    image of a line
    line represented by two points
    look at image of the two points and of their midpoint
    they are either collieanr,
    in which case the image of the line is a line
    or they form a triangle,
    in which case the image of the line is a circle,
    the circumcircle of the triangle

    so what is the circumcircle of a triangle?
    the circumcenter is the intesection of the perpendicualr bisectors
    the radius is the distance
    from the circumcenter
    to one of the vertices of the triangle
    see illuminated triangle

    todo:
    look at method from geometry of complex numbers
    where a generalized circle is repsesented as a Hermitian matrix
